# CL-ITC: Interval Tree Clocks for Common Lisp

If you know ITCs and you're going for CL I suppose you know what you are doing. If not, perhaps start at [Wikipedia on Vector Clocks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_clock). See also [the original paper](http://gsd.di.uminho.pt/members/cbm/ps/itc2008.pdf) and [the original implementation](https://github.com/ricardobcl/Interval-Tree-Clocks). [A implementation in Python](https://github.com/kurin/py-itc) is also available.

Matters or style, praise or abomination are very much welcome to be discussed. Our mission at CoselTech is total customer satisfaction.

## Matters of license

The project page at [the source](https://github.com/ricardobcl/Interval-Tree-Clocks) specifies the LGPL, though the Erlang source file on which this implementation is base states EPL. I do not wish to introduce any further directives or restrictions.
